# Own Protocol

Own is a permissionless protocol for fully collateralized asset swaps, enabling synthetic exposure to any real-world asset onchain.

The protocol creates a market where users can gain exposure to asset performance by paying a floating interest rate, while liquidity providers earn this interest in exchange for offering asset exposure. As the default market makers in the protocol, LPs can also earn from market making.
